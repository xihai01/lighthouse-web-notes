## What do we mean by a Tech Stack?
A stack often refers to a collection of technologies used in a given system.

For example, our TinyApp project used multiple stacks of technologies such as:
- NodeJS for the we server
- Express for the middleware
- EJS for the template engine

There are many different type of stacks. The most popular one is the MEAN stack (NodeJS, Express, Angular and MongoDB)

## ID's vs Classes
Classes imply stylistic or behavioral properties about an element.

Classes should be used more often than ID's.

Information (styling) that is reusable across elements should be kept in classes; otherwise, in ID's.
