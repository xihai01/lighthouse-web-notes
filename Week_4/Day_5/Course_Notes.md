## Data Structures
Arrays are great for organizing a list of things

Objects are great for when we want to be able to look up data quickly using a key

A tree can be great for storing data that has relationships to each other. Trees have nodes and edges. The nodes represent a key entity and contain data relevant to that node. All the connections between the nodes are called edges. The node at the ver top is called a root node and the nodes at the bottom are called the leaf nodes.

## Tree Traversing
Two methods of traversing trees:
1. BFT - Breadth First Traversal will check the closest to the root node before checking nodes that are further away
2. DFT - Depth First Traversal will visit each node down a path to its leaf node before visiting nodes on the next path
