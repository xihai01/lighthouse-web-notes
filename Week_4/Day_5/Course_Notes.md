Algorithmic complexity is akk about how fast or slow a particular algorithm is. We measure the running time of an algorithm by not its speed of execution (because it varies from languages to devices), but by how many elementary operations it performs.

An elementary operation is a single line of code that executes it almost constant time such as,
```javascript
let number = 0;
number += 2;
console.log(number);
```
