Primary Keys are unique identifiers to identify a particular row

Foreign Keys is formed from field values that match the Primary Key stored in another

Primary Key and Foreign Key together must be of the same data types!

## Naming Conventions
Table and field names are written in **snake_case**
Table names are by convention pluralized
The Primary Key for each table will be called id
The Foreign Key naming convention shall contain the singluar of the Primary Key's table name appended with _id

## Data Types
Data types are needed to protect the integrity of the data because SQL will give different permissions to manipulate the data depending on their data type

Another reason is data types are used to tell the database how much room to set aside to store the value

## DOM
When an event happens, an object is created that contains information about the event and is automatically passed along into the callback function.
